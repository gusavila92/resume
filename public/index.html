        I hold a Bachelor of Science in Systems and Computing Engineering.
        I have nine years of professional experience developing software for millions of users across a wide range of companies from telecommunications and delivery services to social networks and banking. I am the main maintainer of an open source project used by tech companies and developers. In my free time I mentor developers.
